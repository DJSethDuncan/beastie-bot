# beastie-bot

A Discord bot.

BeastieBot started as a simple joke, but he is growing smarter.

He can still reply using the trigger words like below:

Example:

```

person > Man I love the Beastie Boys.

BeastieBot > BOOOOYS!!!!!!

person > Ok who installed BeastieBot haha

BeastieBot > HAAAHAAAAAA!!!!!

```

but now he can also respond to requests that start with `bot...`
